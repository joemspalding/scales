# About

An example for a student in Code Louisville to see the power of JS objects + JS array functions.

## Explanation

The code updates the `notes` array via the `updateNotesArray(...)` function. Then the code calls `updateDOM()` where several JS array methods check the state of the `notes` array and `.map(...)` them to HTML elements and `.reduce()` that array of strings to a single string.
